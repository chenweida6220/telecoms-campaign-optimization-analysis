# Telecommunications Campaign Optimization Analysis Project
This project is a part of the Capstone Project at [COOP Careers Fellowship](https://coopcareers.org/).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project was conducted by the Spatial Analyst Pod in response to rising inefficiencies and flatlining ROI in our company’s cross-regional marketing campaigns. We leveraged campaign interaction data—including user clicks, conversions, device types, and location data—across several U.S. states. Our objective was to uncover spatial performance patterns to guide future marketing investment.

### Data Sources
* Internal ad campaign performance logs (Clicks, Conversions, Device Type)
* Geographic identifiers (State, Region)
* Category-level browsing metadata (e.g., Finance, Lifestyle)

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization (Heatmaps, Choropleth Maps)
* ROI & Conversion Rate Calculations
* Segmentation Analysis

### Technologies
* Excel/Google Sheets
* Tableau
